# User Experience

* Text content is easy to read,view across all devices
* Website is highly secured with user's profile secured against intrusion from other users, vistors to the site.

# Design Choices

* Considering this is an Irish slang dinctionary I wanted the color scheme to adopt the tricolor flag colors of Ireland which is green, white and orange.
  The feeling was that it was the most appropriate design choice of colors as users will instantly feel the connection between the Irish tricolors and the slang glossary.
  An image of a leprachaun is present on the homepage to offer imagery but to also offer a well reknowned representation of Irish fiction.
  Features such as login, register, contact form, search bar and collapsible glossary are styled identically for consistency in design. Collapsible, footer,buttons and navbar and sidenav are taken from
  [CSS Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) for instant responsiveness and positive looking user interface


## typography

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the site. The font family adopted  was  Mate SC as I felt it was an attractive, readbale and eligible font to use. In case Mate SC did not
  load sans serif was used as the back up font.
